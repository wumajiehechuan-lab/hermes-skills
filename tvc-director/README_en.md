# TVC Director

[中文版](README.md)

From product brief to cinematic TVC keyframes — your AI advertising creative director.

A skill that turns your AI agent into a **TVC Advertising Creative Director**, handling the complete creative pipeline for television commercials and brand advertising: from a product brief to production-ready multi-grid storyboard image prompts and video prompts.

## How It Works

The workflow mirrors real TVC advertising production stages:

```
"Make a 30-second TVC for an outdoor camera"
        ↓
  Phase 1: Creative Brief        ← Client Brief
  Phase 2: Creative Proposal     ← Creative Director Pitch
  Phase 3: Look Development      ← Art Style Lock
  Phase 4: Pre-production        ← Casting & Wardrobe + Product Photography + Location Scouting
  Phase 5: Storyboard & Shoot    ← Storyboard + On-set Shooting
  Phase 6: Review & Iteration    ← Director's Review + Revisions
  Phase 7: Delivery              ← Final Delivery
        ↓
  Copy-paste-ready multi-grid storyboard image prompts,
  video prompts & creative docs
```

## Key Features

- **Mirrors real TVC production** — Casting & wardrobe, product photography, location scouting, storyboarding, shooting — each stage has a corresponding AI prompt deliverable
- **End-to-end creative pipeline** — From a one-line brief to deliverable storyboard prompts and video scripts, fully AI-driven
- **8 TVC narrative models** — Problem-solution, cinematic product breakdown, brand world crosscut, and more
- **Cinematic visual system** — 5 art style presets (A-E), 12 scene types, per-second camera choreography
- **Product + brand world dual narrative** — Not just product close-ups, but crosscut storytelling in real-world scenes
- **Copy-paste ready** — Output prompts work directly in Nano Banana Pro / Seedance with no rework needed

## Quick Start: Making a Car TVC

A real end-to-end example — from a reference photo to a 15-second commercial.

### Step 1 — Provide a reference image + one-line brief

> "Make a 15-second TVC for this silver sedan"

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d774888-0dbb-4fb7-a861-ca3116b812b7" width="400" alt="Reference: silver sedan" />

The AI enters the full creative pipeline: brief analysis → creative concept → art style → asset generation → storyboard + video script.

### Step 2 — AI generates multiview prompts → Nano Banana Pro renders

The AI outputs product multiview prompts. Copy to Nano Banana Pro (edit mode, pass in the reference image) to get standardized multi-angle product shots:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d97df38-79f1-4a6a-a6bb-0fdbd731faca" width="600" alt="Product multiview" />

### Step 3 — AI generates 3×3 storyboard prompts → Nano Banana Pro renders

The AI outputs a 3×3 multi-grid storyboard prompt (with per-panel composition, lighting, and camera direction). Copy to Nano Banana Pro (edit mode, pass in multiview + environment images):

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca54c8a-e1c2-4a13-8e67-461ea327f2ab" width="600" alt="3×3 storyboard grid" />

### Step 4 — AI generates video prompts → Seedance renders video

The AI outputs a Seedance Multi-Phase video script (5 phases / 15s). Use the storyboard grid as the first frame + product multiview as the anchor, dual-image input to Seedance for the final video.

### Output Summary

| Deliverable | Tool | Purpose |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Product multiview | Nano Banana Pro (edit) | Product anchor for subsequent steps |
| 3×3 storyboard grid | Nano Banana Pro (edit) | Video first frame + visual QA |
| Multi-Phase video script | Seedance | Generate 15s final video |
| Creative brief document | — | Full creative brief for archival |

## Design Philosophy

Traditional AI-generated ads tend to be an endless loop of "product + black background + rotation." TVC Director is different — it organizes prompt generation around the real TVC production SOP, so every prompt maps to a specific production stage:

- **Narrative-driven** — Determine the narrative model and creative direction first, then generate visuals; no mindless template filling
- **Dual-world crosscutting** — Product close-ups interweave with brand world scenes, telling stories like a real TVC
- **Per-second camera design** — Every storyboard panel has explicit shot size, angle, lighting, and transition logic
- **Progressive human-AI collaboration** — Intervene and adjust at every phase; not a black-box one-click generator

## Three Core Capabilities

### 1. Cinematic Product Breakdown

Product as sole protagonist, pure studio, multi-phase product micro-films:

- Component disassembly/assembly animations (floating parts, exploded views, snap-back)
- Material macro shots (brushed metal, glass refraction, carbon fiber weave)
- Precise per-second camera choreography (ultra-slow reveal → explosive rotation → macro dive)
- Cinematic studio lighting (low-key, side light silhouettes, light flowing with rotation)

### 2. Brand World Crosscut

Brand world and product world take turns, connected via match cuts:

- Action cameras → skydiving, diving, skiing, climbing
- Off-road vehicles → mountain roads, desert, snow
- Each Phase stays in one world; world switches happen between Phases

### 3. Lifestyle Film

Product stays in the brand world throughout — no studio cutaways:

- Running shoes on feet, watches on wrists, glasses on faces
- Highlighted through cinematography (low-angle tracking, slow motion, depth-of-field shifts)
- Hero Shot concentrated at the end
